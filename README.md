Mentorship - Programming Track

Objective: Build a mini game using C++, SFML, and Dear IMGUI
Theme Topic: Reborn

For my game I decided to take a story driven approach that incorporates a mini plot and dialogue that follows the theme of "Reborn". In this game, you are tiger roaming the jungle and come across a dying tree. The asks for your help to retrieve magical water in the abandoned temple. 

My main focus while programming was using State Machines. The project includes four main states: Menu, Gameplay, Dialogue, and EndGame. Some updates I would like to add in the future include importing the dialogue from a.txt file and cleaning up the collision. Moreover, I would like to expand on the inside of the temple.
